## 2026-09-23: MT5 skill, M1 agent, desktop app, Hermes

### Requests
1. A skill covering how to fully use MT5, how to trade stocks on MT5, and trading in general. Always M1 candles.
2. An agent tuned for an RTX 4060 + Ryzen 5 7600.
3. An app instead of typing commands, with Hermes for memory, able to do other things too.
4. Question: can the agent run from the file system instead of RAM?

### Done
- **Skill** `.claude/skills/mt5-trading/`: SKILL.md + 9 references (platform, stocks, fundamentals, M1 playbook, MQL5, Python API, instruments, hardware/agent, app & Hermes) + 3 scripts. Validated and packaged as `mt5-trading.skill`.
- **Claude subagent** `.claude/agents/mt5-m1-trader.md`.
- **M1 agent** `agent/`: causal features, spread-aware triple-barrier labels, XGBoost (GPU train, CPU predict), risk gates, paper/live broker, journal, STOP kill switch. Tested on 60k synthetic M1 bars (train, save, load, predict).
- **MCP server** `mcp_server/mt5_mcp.py`: 10 tools with order guards, stdio + HTTP. mcp pinned `<2` (2.x renamed FastMCP; caught in testing).
- **Desktop app** `app/` + `Trading Bot.bat`: Market / Agent / Train / Hermes / Settings tabs, RAM and VRAM meters, hold-to-flatten, sizing calculator, vendored chart library (works offline). API tested; UI screenshot-checked with mock MT5 data.
- **Hermes**: Hermes Agent (Nous Research) via its API server on :8642 + MCP bridge, or local `hermes3:8b` in Ollama with SQLite memory and 15 tools. Setup guide `hermes/SETUP.md`.
- **RAM question**: answered. Running code must be in RAM, but all persistent state is on disk and the model lives in VRAM and unloads when idle (details in `hermes/SETUP.md`).
- **Graphify wiki**: `graphify-out/wiki/` (hand-built; the graphify install was blocked in the cloud sandbox).

### Not verified here (needs the Windows PC)
- Live MT5 connection, real order_send, CUDA training on the 4060, pywebview window, Ollama/Hermes Agent responses. All were mocked or stubbed in tests.

### Next ideas
- Run: Train tab → Fetch data → Train → Paper mode for 1–2 weeks → Demo.
- Optional: news/economic-calendar blackout feed; PyTorch sequence model if it beats XGBoost out of sample.
- Regenerate the graphify wiki locally with the real `graphify` tool.
